## **_Description_**

#### This is my recreation of the classic game Snake. The user directs the snake on their screen using the arrow buttons to try to hit and eat an apple. When the apple is eaten the snake grows longer by one unit. If the user hits a wall or runs into the snake's body they lose and the game is over. My game will record both the current score and the high score.
